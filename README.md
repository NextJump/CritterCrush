# Critter Crush

Crush critters for honor and glory

## Setup

**This is still very much in flux, if you notice it's out of date please update these instructions.**

Clone the repository into your gopath

    mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/nextjump
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nextjump
    git clone https://github.com/boombador/BotWorld.git

CD into the repository and start your server with the following command

    go run critter.go

You will be able to see the game at localhost:8080/game

Still needs more tweaking before the PLAY button works with this new layout...
